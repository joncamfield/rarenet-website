# rarenet-website

This is a rebuilding of the [RaReNet](https://RaReNet.org) website in Jekyll for easier hosting and management by members.

RaReNet (Rapid Response Network) is an active network of people who in some form or another are working on digital emergency response. The group is composed by technical experts, support organizations and individuals who are connected to civil society, activists and journalists on the ground.

This site uses [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/) as a remote theme in github pages -- see the [installation documentation](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/installation/) for alternative installation methods. This means most of the layouts and includes are not part of this repository, only overrides to those.
