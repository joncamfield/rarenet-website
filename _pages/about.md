## WHAT IS RARENET?

Rarenet (Rapid Response Network) is an active network of people who in some form or another are working on digital emergency response. The group is composed by technical experts, support organizations and individuals who are connected to civil society, activists and journalists on the ground.

The network coordinates efforts between the different members by sharing emergency cases and knowledge on digital emergencies with the aim of supporting people who are facing digital threats.

Currently, Rarenet operates on best efforts of all members and its activities are endorsed by the entire group.

## MISSION

The goal of the Rarenet initiative is to close the gap and increase cooperation between two large groups: civil society, activists on the one side and organizations or individuals working in Information Technologiesâ€™ security on the other side.

Rarenet is composed by members of both groups that have decided to donate time and resources to the community in order to globally improve the security awareness of civil society, journalists and activists. Rarenet also helps to report incidents that has been made aware of and provide solutions.

Funding of the Rarenet comes from direct contributions from its members and it does not rely on any kind of external resources. If not decided by the group as a whole, Rarenet will not seek funding for its coordination activities.
